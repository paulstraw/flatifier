# Flatifier — An internal Flaticons tool for generating icons from .psd files

I made this tool for Zach Roszczewski's [Flaticons](http://flaticons.co), to help him generate a nice .zip of all the assets he needs for distribution. Basically, run `flatifier package {{psdFilePath}}`, and it spits out an .ai, .psd, and .pngs (1x, 2x, 3x, 4x) for each layer, creates a bunch of .svgs from the .ai files, generates a font using the svgs (using [Font Custom](http://fontcustom.com/)), and zips all that up. It's probably not very interesting or helpful to you unless you're battling with the Photoshop JS API like I did while making it; basically I just put it up here so I could publish it to NPM and get it to Zach easier, and maybe help some poor soul who's trying to export stuff from Photoshop in the future.

If you really want to mess around with this for some reason, you can `npm install flaticons-flatifier -g`. MIT License, only tested on the Macs (and .psd layout) that Zach and I are using, no support, no guarantees that it will stay the same (or even continue to exist in this form) in the future, and all that stuff.
